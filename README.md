# socket-canvas-server-app

A server created using express and node. Run npm run dev, to start the server locally on port 3000.
This has to be used in conjuction with my other repo - canvas-client-app. 
Set up the canvas client app (Ionic), and then draw on the whiteboard present on the draw tab, have the client app open on the 2nd device with "view" tab selected.
The drawing will be viewed in real time.
